        <p class="pictures">The American Civil War had started with the issue of slavery, especially the extension of slavery into the western territories. It started in 1861 and ended in 1865 with in that period there was immense combat that created 620,000 to 750,000 soldierâ€™s deaths. Which is a higher number of deaths in World War I and World War II combined. 
           The Confederacy fell and slavery was abolished in the entire country. Some of the biggest advancements in technology in the Civil War were the repeating rifle, iron clad and the use of the train systems. </p>
